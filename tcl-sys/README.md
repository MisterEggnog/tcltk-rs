# Tcl/Tk rust bindings
Rust bindings for the Tcl interpreter & Tk graphics library.

## Warning this library is completely experimental!
Currently this library is tested on Linux, it has not been tested in any other environment.
Nor has it been tested for systems that do not have Tcl/Tk as an available library.

This should probably build for Mac OSX provided it has Tcl/Tk & pkg-config installed.
This has not been tested.
